# DSND-capstone
## This is my capstone project at Udacity which is about finding donors
In this project we used some libraries that widely used in python-data-science:

1- 'numpy'

2- 'pandas'

3- 'time'

4- 'IPython.display'

5- 'visuals'

6- '%matplotlib inline'

7- from 'sklearn.preprocessing' we imported 'MinMaxScaler'

8- from 'sklearn.model_selection' we imported 'train_test_split'

9- from 'sklearn.metrics' we imported 'fbeta_score', 'accuracy_score'

10- from 'sklearn.tre'e we imported 'DecisionTreeClassifier'

11- from 'sklearn.ensemble' import 'AdaBoostClassifier', 'BaggingClassifier'

12- from 'sklearn.svm' import 'SVC'

13- from 'sklearn.model_selection' we imported 'GridSearchCV'

14- from 'sklearn.metrics' we imported 'make_scorer'

15- from 'sklearn.metrics' we imported 'f1_score'

16- from 'sklearn.tree' we imported 'DecisionTreeClassifier'

17- from 'sklearn.tree' we imported 'DecisionTreeClassifier'

18- from 'sklearn.base' we imported 'clone'


## The motivation for the project is to implement the supervisor learning on the complex problem to ease the problems and eleminate waste of time in the similar problem and I want to enhance myself in the supervisor learning.



## The files in this repository are the following:

1- census.csv -- the data we used to analyse and train the model on it.

2- finding_donors_sufyan_final.ipynb -- my model's code that I did in python using Jupyter notebook.

3- test_census.csv -- the test data.

4- visuals.py .


## The reults of the poject was as written in the jupyter notebook which are:

" We did use three different model Adaboost classifier, Bagging classifier, and SVC. Also, we did see differences in the time and accuracy to train our data on the models, and we selected the best one of that which is the Decision Tree classifier. Then we trained the data and measure that accuracy before optimized the model and after optimized. Next, we did the model on the most effective features after we identify that features. "
